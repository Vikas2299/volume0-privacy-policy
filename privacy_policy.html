        <h1>Privacy Policy for Volume0</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: April 22, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to Volume0, a volume management app developed by Vikas Sharma. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Volume0 collects the following types of data to provide its functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Activity</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: We access notifications from supported apps (Spotify and SoundCloud) to display song information (e.g., song title, artist) in the app’s interface. This allows us to detect when ads are playing and adjust the volume accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreground App Usage</strong> (if applicable): Volume0 may require Usage Access permission to detect which app is currently active (e.g., Spotify) to apply the correct volume settings. This data is not stored or shared.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>App Configuration Data</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>We store your preferences for volume settings, such as the volume level during ads and whether volume adjustment is enabled for each supported app (Spotify, SoundCloud). This data is saved locally on your device using SharedPreferences.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information (e.g., name, email address, phone number), location data, financial information, device IDs, or any other sensitive data.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>The data we collect is used solely to provide Volume0’s core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To display song information in the app’s interface.</li>
            <li>To adjust the device volume based on your settings when supported apps are active or playing ads.</li>
            <li>To save your volume preferences locally on your device for future use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your data with third parties. All data collected by Volume0 (e.g., notification data, app configuration) is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers or shared with other entities.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Volume0 stores app configuration data (e.g., volume settings) locally on your device using SharedPreferences. Notification data is processed in real-time and not stored long-term. We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, but no system is completely secure. Please contact us if you have concerns about data security.</p>

        <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
        <p>Volume0 requires the following permissions to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notification Access</strong>: To monitor notifications from supported apps (Spotify, SoundCloud) and detect song info or ad playback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Volume0 is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by updating this page. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.</p>
